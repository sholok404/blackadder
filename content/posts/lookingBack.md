description: "I'd rather not though"

I write this entry at about 0230 in the morning on the 27th of June, 2024. Tomorrow, at 1400, I am to join BMA. I joined BMA on 20th December 2023. This leave marked the end of my first term and the commencement of my second.

A lot can be written about the way my pattern of thought has changed over the last 6 months, but I won't dwell too much on it. Most likely, stories will slowly simmer out through my subsequent entries that could be weaved into a narrative that maps out my metamorphosis from a civil sack of shit to the military equivalent.

Let this entry instead be the commencement of an online journal that I can eventually look back at, and that can perhaps even be of mild entertainment (and maybe even educational) value to others.

Regards,

OC Syed
